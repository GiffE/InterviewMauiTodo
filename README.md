# Interview .NET MAUI Take home
This is a quick implementation of a .net maui todo list that I created for the purpose of an interview take home project.  There were areas I definately cut some corners to try to get this done quickly.

## Requirements
- [x] create and delete todo list
- [x] add/edit/delete items from todo list
- [x] mark to do list items completed
- [ ] no existing todo list on clean install (I have testing data in there)
- [ ] open new todo list on create
- [ ] todo lists persisted through app restart (I have to get them to save/load in the data service)
- [ ] unit tests
- [ ] code cleanup/comments

## Project Request
>## Project Scope: 
>Create a cross-platform mobile application in Xamarin Forms or .NET MAUI for To-Do list management. The application should allow the current user to create and manage to-do lists, add/edit/delete items from to-do lists, mark to-do list items as completed. 

>## Product Perspective: 
>On fresh install, there will be no existing lists. The application should allow the user to create a new to-do list and name it. Once the to-do list is created, it is opened and the app should now allow users to add new items, modify/delete existing items and mark to-do items as completed. 

>Also, the user should be able to create other to-do lists, view all available to-do lists, open a to-do list from the list of existing lists, delete from existing to-do list collection. 

>To-Do lists and items should persist through an app restart. 

>## Notes: 
>The application should be structured to support both Android and iOS devices but only one platform should be implemented (preferably Android). We donâ€™t want this task to be extremely labor-intensive for you, but some UX design would be welcomed, and a handful of unit tests should also be included.
